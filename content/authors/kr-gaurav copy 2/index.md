I (Kr. Gaurav) write here. I am a software engineer and currently working as a lead into Devops and Cloud. I started working into Embedded, Linux and Computer Vision after graduating from college. I made electronic automation devices like GPS tracker for truckers, LED Billboards for Agencies and softwares like OMR Sheet Reader for a coaching institure and Automatic Palmistry Prediction for a dating site.


I have been working on web technologies since early 2015 and sicnce then have worked on HTML5 Mobile apps, PHP Symphony and Laravel Apps. Once I knew the web ecosystem I moved into Devops. Where, I started with Vagrant based dev machines, Python Automation integrated into Electron Apps for tech companies.


Since 2018 I am working with AWS and Kubernetes and currently I adminster the cloud and deployments. During this time I created a few apps to monitor and support dev teams and production load as needed by the company.
