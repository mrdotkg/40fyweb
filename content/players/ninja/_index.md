### Free Time Gamer | Full Time Developer

I have been working on web technologies since early 2015 and sicnce then have worked on HTML5 Mobile apps, PHP Symphony and Laravel Apps. Once I knew the web ecosystem I moved into Devops. Where, I started with Vagrant based dev machines, Python Automation integrated into Electron Apps for tech companies.


Since 2018 I am working with AWS and Kubernetes and currently I adminster the cloud and deployments. During this time I created a few apps to monitor and support dev teams and production load as needed by the company.

I publish my work here in the form of Blogs and Projects. Do let me know if you liked them.
